|    1     |      Planning how the game will go, which topics I want to include and what vibe I want my game to give.         |                 |               |                        |           |
|    2    |         Searching for ASCII images, emoticons and emojis that I can use in my game to make it look more visually pleasing .    |  Finding out that I don't want to add any ASCII images or emoticons to my game since they don't fit the aesthetic of the game and one of the goals is the game to be visually satisfying.               |               |                        |           |
|      3   |    Starting to write the beginning part of the code where it asks for user's name .      |  Having a basic intro to have my game will look like .               |               |                        |           |
|    4   |         Learning some user-friendly psychological tricks that I can use   | Adding the user-title part to my game to have give some optional parts in the game to the user which I've relised while researching that helps the user to connect to the product more.                |               |                        |           |
